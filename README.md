# My-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML structures the game board, CSS styles it for a clean look, and JavaScript handles the game logic such as player turns, win detection, and draw conditions. The project demonstrates basic front-end web development skills and interactive gameplay in the browser.
